# DigiSpark Attiny85 RubberDucky
DigiSpark Attiny85 is a light weight and inexpensive option to the [Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky). Because it's possible to use it as HID thanks to "DigiKeyboard.h" it can be use as a keyboard to send keystrokes to a computer which can be use for pranking your friends to creating a backdoor in a target system. 

## What's here?
I have created this repo for sharing my payloads for DigiSpark Attiny85. All the payloads are tested on Attiny85 and created on Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started
For people that are new to this I would suggest visiting [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/how-to-build-a-rubber-ducky-usb-with-arduino-using-a-digispark-module) for instruction on setting up development environment for Attiny85.
